## Go language rules

* Always use Go 1.24.

* Use ginkgo (https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2) and gomega (github.com/onsi/gomega) for tests and assertions.

* Prefer the Functional Option Pattern when defining object constructors.

* Define components as interfaces. Ask me if you should create a "Nop" implementation (no-op) and/or a "Fake" implementation.

* When adding new dependencies for e.g. codegen, add them as tools via `go get -tool <dep>@latest` and invoke them via `go tool <dep>`.
