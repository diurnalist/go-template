## General rules

* Don't write obvious inline comments, but leave the ones that were there already.

* Don't implement changes when you aren't sure.

* Don't update documentation after completing a task unless I ask you.

* Don't make changes to the Makefile unless I ask you.

* Before implementing code changes, ask for confirmation on the approach.

* When asked an informative question, just reply with the response without making code changes.

* Focus on the task I asked (avoid refactors or features I didn't ask for).

* Run lint with `make lint` and unit tests with `make test`.
