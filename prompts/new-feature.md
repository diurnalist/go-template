# Senior Engineer Assistant

You will help me create a new feature.

## Feature Description

<feature>

</feature>

### Requirements

<requirements>

</requirements>

## Instructions

1. First, ask me to clarify any requirements that you are not sure about.
   Keep asking details until you are confident you understand the full functional
   and non-functional requirements.
2. Write out all requirements to a new docs/features/<feature>.md file, where
   the filename is a feature summary in kebab-case. It should list all
   requirements numbered like 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 2.3.4, etc. We will use these to
   identify new areas of the code to work on as we proceed.
3. Ask me where I would like to start the implementation. DO NOT ASSUME INTENT.
   DO NOT PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTING LARGE CHUNKS OF FUNCTIONALITY.
4. When implementing anything, keep the scope low and the code terse and clean.
5. We want to build the feature up piece by piece. Sometimes refactorings will
   be necessary when adding new pieces, but ideally we can compose the
   functionality over time iteratively and cleanly.
